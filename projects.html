      <h3>Slackbot App</h3>
      <p>In the Summer of 2020, myself and two other interns worked on a cross organizational project between HR and engineering. The overarching goal of the project was to create an "HR Intranet" via Slack to disseminate information to employees in an easy to use, chatty way. </p>
      <p>We decided a Slack Chatbot would be the best solution. Users in the organization's workspace could be in any channel, invoke a slash command, and our application would respond with links, documents, forms, or messages. The first iteration of this project would be a handful of links to Workday pages via the Employee okta sites.</p>
      <p>The architecture of the app started off by creating a Bot app using the Slack API. Next, we had to compose the payload that would be returned to the user invoking the slash command. Slack has a great "Block Kit Builder" for this. For the backend, our company tech stack uses NestJS and Typescript. The Controllers in NestJS are responsible for routing HTTP requests to desired endpoints. We used the Post decorators to instantiate a handler for the specific endpoint, which would call a method we defined in a NestJS Service Provider and send the body, or the slash command text, to the Service method for handling. In our Service, we take care of authentication tokens and Slack Channel Ids. We define a secretMessage method that makes the Slackbot response ephemeral to the specific user, and then define a method for each different slash command that defines a payload to send back to the user."</p>    
      <p>Further iterations I worked on included displaying popup modal forms on command invocation. Slack has their own web api you can use for block kit displays, and the setup is almost identical to the process describe above: with the addition of two additional methods in the Service. To handle any interactions with modals in Slack, we need to deinfe methods that receive payloads from the modal form a user filled out, and in this instance we wanted to send that content in a Slack message to an HR team member. The structure of this method is similar to the slash command methods above, except that we need to get a specific user ID to route the message to vs. using the one sent by invoking the slash command.</p>
      <p>Before we were ready to demo to senior leadership, we needed to test this thoroughly ourselves. However, we couldn't use a public API endpoint due to their being sensitive company information, and we couldn't deploy our code to the production API without knowing it worked! So we used ngrok to create a locally available tunnel, routing our localhost:3000 port to an ngrok port. Then in the Slack API web portal, we updated each slash command to route the request to the ngrok address with the corresponding Controller suffixes we defined. Now, we could locally test the slash commands!</p>
      <p>With all of our slash commands working, we pushed to the product Github branch and went through a code review that mostly had to do with double checking we had types for every object, per company standard. Our code was approved, and we needed to change the request URL for each slash command to the global public URL now available. After that, we were ready to demo to HR!</p>
      <p>The presentation went off without a hitch, and viewers were all equally excited. The head of HR was ecstatic, and mentioned that the quote they received from Slack to implement our solution was $28,000. Everyone was thrilled with our work in the short two weeks and there are plans to expand the dictionary of slash commands and employee interactivity within Slack.</p>
