    <h2>About Me</h2>
      </center>
    <p>Hey there! I'm Kat, a Software Engineer wrapping up my degree in Computer Science at Texas A&M in December 2020. My background and work experience is primarily in web and mobile applications. I've used a variety of frameworks to develop those applications in C#, Ruby, and JavaScript. You can download my current resume above, or check out my home page for a more detailed overview of my previous projects.</p>
    <p>Outside of work and school I've got a few cliche interests like solo travel, playing fetch with my dog (or keep away ... which ever mood strikes him), gardening, and then there's reading books from the ~true adventure~ genre, niche perfumes, pathology/etiology (BEFORE Coronavirus was cool), and NPR Tiny Desk Concert videos.</p>
    <p>Well back to my career interests ... I'm always excited to learn about and engage in new fields of software development/ computer science. Currently on my mind is SEO, systems for low code development, enterprise applications, and data <i>question mark</i> ?? Idk, it's the new oil or something; I should probably learn about it.</p>
    <p>I love the full-stack web development space and am fairly content here because I think it allows opportunities to encounter a wide range of interesting problems, and the ability to integrate some of the newest cutting edge technologies in order to enhance projects.</p>
